## Function of the Contao Manager

The Contao Manager is a tool that provides a graphical interface for
easy management of your Contao installation. In principle, the manager
executes the necessary commands for the Composer in the background.

The following tasks can be performed with the manager, among others:

- Install Contao
- Update Contao
- Search extensions
- Install extensions
- Uninstall extensions
- Rebuild production cache
- Unlock install tool
- Activate debug mode
- Dump autoloader
- Run installer
- Clear cache

Further functions are planned for the future, such as set system settings
or run the Contao Check.

The Contao Manager is optional and not necessary for the operation of
Contao. The tool, however, makes it easier for beginners to install Contao
and manage extensions, as no composer skills are required.

It is also possible to manage the installation of Contao and Extensions
directly from the command line via Composer.
